# Android prebuilts system

The Android prebuilts system lets you create pre-compiled packages for AOSP.
It's main purpose is to speed up Android development.
Compiling AOSP usually takes a very long time,
especially for the first time.
Although AOSP can make use of ccache for subsequent builds,
compiling a fresh checkout usually takes ages.
It gets even worse on not-so-beefy hardware.

The Android prebuilts system tries to mitigate this.
It provides prebuilt packages for heavy modules (in terms of compile time).
It is aimed at developers for a fast edit-compile-run cycle.

Currently this is a proof-of-concept with limitations.
Look at the [Hacking](#hacking) section below for missing features.

# Installation

Add this repository to your (local) manifest
and check it out to ```prebuilts/android```.

Apply the following patch to ```build/core/main.mk```.

```make
--- a/core/main.mk
+++ b/core/main.mk

# Usage

Prebuilts are only enabled for engineering builds and userdebug builds.
They are entirely disabled for user builds on purpose.

On first-time use of the prebuilts system you need to popuate prebuilts.
These will be used automatically in subsequent runs,
even after you deleted the entire ```$OUT``` directory.

To populate prebuilts, run

```
 $ m prebuilts
```

Prebuilts will be placed under ```$(TOP)/prebuilts/android/{target,host}```.
Each target device and build variant has its own directory.
The directory structure is chosen so that you can create separate repositories for the binaries.
These repositories then can be used to prepopulate other build hosts via (local) manifest.

It is recommended to re-populate prebuilts every now and then.
Prebuilts will not be recompiled if not necessary.
Prebuilts will not be used for modules that have another version than the prebuilt binary.

# Hacking

Yes, please!
If you find an issue,
open a bug report on Github.
Fork this project on Github and send pull requests.

This prebuilts system aims to be a drop-in solution for AOSP builds.
Other than the on-line patch for the [installation](#installation),
there should be no need to touch upstream code.

Known TODOs are:

 * implement proper multiarch (arm64) support
 * implement support for host binaries
 * prebuild all binaries
